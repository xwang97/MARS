The friend in this scenario took possession and then recorded the deed, while the cousin only recorded her deed after learning about the friend's possession. It seems like the court is likely to decide in favor of the friend, as he fulfilled the requirements of the recording act by recording his deed before the cousin.\n\nAnswer: C) For the friend, because a subsequent good-faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.", "reflection": "Mistakes (if any): \n\nAnswer: C) For the friend, because a subsequent good-faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.", "total_tokens": 967, "id": 13255, "single_score": 0, "score": 0}
{"response": "Thoughts: While the restaurant may argue they took reasonable steps to prevent foreign objects in their food, the fact remains that a metal fish hook in a sandwich is an unreasonably dangerous product.

{"response": "Thoughts: The Rule in Shelley's Case states that if the remainder interest is limited to the heirs of the life tenant, then the remainder interest is merged with the life estate, resulting in the life tenant having a fee simple absolute. In this case, the son effectively conveyed a fee simple absolute to his friend by selling the property, so he should be able to convey marketable title to the buyer. \nAnswer: B) the son's succeeding, because he had a fee simple to convey.", "reflection": "Mistakes (if any): None\n\nAnswer: B) the son's succeeding, because he had a fee simple to convey.", "total_tokens": 875, "id": 13551, "single_score": 1, "score": 1}
