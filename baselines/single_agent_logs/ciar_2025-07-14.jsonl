{"response": "Thoughts: \n\n1. **Let's denote:**\n    *  'x' as the distance Ram walks before meeting Sita.\n    * 'y' as the time (in minutes) Sita saves by meeting Ram.\n\n2. **Ram's walking time:** Since Ram arrived an hour early, he walked for 60 minutes.\n\n3. **Sita's saved time:** Sita saves 30 minutes on the drive back home.\n\n4. **Relationship between walking time and saved time:** The time Sita saves is equal to the time Ram walked plus the time it would have taken Sita to drive the distance Ram walked.\n\n5. **Setting up the equation:**\n    * Time Sita saves = Time Ram walked + Time Sita would have taken to drive the distance Ram walked.\n    * 30 = x/ (Ram's walking speed) + x / (Sita's driving speed)\n\n6. **Simplifying the equation:** We don't know Ram's walking speed or Sita's driving speed, but we can express them in terms of each other. Since Sita drives at a uniform speed, the time it takes her to drive a certain distance is proportional to the distance.\n\n7. **Assuming:** Let's assume Sita's driving speed is 'k' times faster than Ram's walking speed. This means:\n    * Time Sita takes to drive 'x' distance = x / (k * Ram's walking speed)\n\n8. **Substituting:** Now we can substitute this into our equation:\n    * 30 = x / (Ram's walking speed) + x / (k * Ram's walking speed)\n\n9. **Solving for x:**  We can simplify and solve this equation for 'x', which represents the distance Ram walked.\n\nAnswer: 15", "total_tokens": 592, "id": 46, "score": 0, "question": "Ram used to arrive at the railway station every day at 6 pm from work. As soon as Ram arrived at the station, his wife Sita too arrives at the station by car to pick him up. Both drive back home. One day Ram arrived at the station one hour early and thought of taking a walk back to home. He started walking when after covering a specific distance, he meets with Sita. Both drive back home and this time they reached 30 minutes earlier than the usual time. How long has Ram been walking?\nIt is known that Sita drove every day at a uniform speed.", "gt_answer": 45.0}
{"response": "Thoughts: \n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to get one plane around the world while ensuring all planes return to the starting point. This means planes can act as refueling stations for each other.\n\n2. **The Key Insight:** The trick is to have planes meet in mid-air for refueling.\n\n3. **The Solution:**\n    * Plane 1 starts the journey.\n    * Plane 2 takes off when Plane 1 has traveled 1/4 of the way around the world. Plane 2 refuels Plane 1, allowing Plane 1 to continue to the halfway point.\n    * Plane 2, now with less fuel, returns to the island.\n    * Plane 3 takes off when Plane 1 is at the halfway point. Plane 3 refuels Plane 1, allowing Plane 1 to complete its journey.\n    * Plane 3, now with less fuel, returns to the island.\n\nAnswer: 3", "total_tokens": 418, "id": 47, "score": 1, "question": "On an Island, there is an airport that has an unlimited number of identical air-planes. Each air-plane has a fuel capacity to allow it to fly exactly 1/2 way around the world, along a great circle. The planes have the ability to refuel in flight without loss of speed or spillage of fuel. Though the fuel is unlimited, the island is the only source of fuel. You can ignore the time and fuel consumption of refuelling.\nWhat is the minimum number of air-planes required to get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport?", "gt_answer": 3.0}
