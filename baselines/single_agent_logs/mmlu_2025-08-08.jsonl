However, laws regulating littering serve to maintain public order and cleanliness, and do not specifically target free speech.

Given that the littering occurred in a public park and it disrupts the public interest in maintaining cleanliness, the ordinance can be validly applied. Thus, while the protestor's actions are expressive in nature, the government has a legitimate interest in regulating littering without infringing upon the core of free speech.
