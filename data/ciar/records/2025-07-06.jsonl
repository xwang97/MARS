The probability that Alice is in the third bar can be calculated as the probability that she was not found in the first two bars and is in the third bar.\n   - Probability that Alice was not in the first bar = 2/3\n   - Probability that Alice was not in the second bar given she was not in the first bar = 2/3\n   - Therefore, the probability that she is in the third bar = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.\n5.

Specifically, the calculations of the probability that Alice is in the third bar after Bob has checked two bars are incorrect. Here are the detailed errors:\n\n1. The probability that Alice is in the third bar is not directly calculated as (2/3) * (2/3). This calculation assumes independence, which is not necessarily true here since Alice's presence in one bar is not independent of her being in another.\n\n2. The correct approach is to consider the conditional probability. Given that Alice has a 9/10 chance of going out and each bar has an equal chance of 1/3, the probability that Alice is in any of the bars is still 1/3. However, after Bob checks two bars and does not find Alice, the probability space changes.\n\n3. The author incorrectly assumes that only two scenarios are possible: Alice is in the third bar or at home. Instead, the correct probability should be based on the total possible outcomes, which include Alice being in one of the three bars or at home. Given the information, we should recalculate the probabilities based on the remaining possible scenarios.\n\nAnswer: Revisiting the problem with correct conditional probability, the probability that Alice is in the third bar is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, since the conditional probability should adjust for the two bars already checked. Therefore, the probability that Alice is in the third bar given that she is not in the first two is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Alice in third bar} | \\text{not in first two}) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nHowever, this is an over-simplification as the total conditional probability similarly needs to account for her being at home.

The key is understanding that the spare tyre is only used to replace a worn-out tyre as they are rotated.

The reviewers correctly point out that while the total distance that can be covered by all five tyres is indeed 100,000 miles, the car can only travel a distance equal to the distance one tyre can cover multiplied by the number of tyres, which is 4 in this case. This is because the spare tyre is used as needed, replacing a worn-out tyre as the tyres are rotated. Thus, the maximum distance the car can travel before any tyre is fully worn out is \\(4 \\times 20000 = 80000\\) miles.\n\nHowever, the reviewers' collective conclusion that the car can travel 40,000 miles is also incorrect.

Normally, Ram arrives at the railway station at 6 pm and his wife picks him up immediately after he arrives, so they reach home at 7 pm.\n\nSince Ram left the station one hour early (at 5 pm) and walked for a certain distance, let's call that distance \\(d\\), and the time he walked as \\(t\\). During this time, Sita started driving from home and met Ram at some point, say at a distance \\(D - d\\) from the station. After meeting Ram, they drove together the remaining distance to Ram's home, which is \\(d\\). They reached home 30 minutes (0.5 hours) earlier than usual, i.e., they reached home at 6:30 pm instead of 7 pm.\n\nIn the usual scenario, the time Sita takes to travel from home to the station and back to Ram\u2019s home is 1 hour, so she travels \\(D + D = 2D\\) in 1 hour.
