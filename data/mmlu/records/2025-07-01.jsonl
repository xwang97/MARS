This is a strong contender because a guardianship usually means the ward cannot legally enter into contracts, rendering them void.\n- Option D suggests the contract is voidable at the father's option. This is unlikely because the father's lack of capacity due to guardianship makes the contract void, not merely voidable.\n\nThe most accurate answer is that the contract is void due to the father's lack of legal capacity under guardianship, regardless of his lucidity at the time or the seller's good faith.\n\nAnswer: (C)", "review1": "Decision: right  \nConfidence: 5  \nJustification: The author's analysis is consistent with the legal principles governing guardianship and contractual capacity.
