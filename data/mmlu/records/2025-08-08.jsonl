The mother's emotional response arose from the threat made against her child, which could potentially establish a valid claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

{"author_response": "Thoughts: When the demand for a product is inelastic, it means that consumers are not very responsive to price changes. If the price of the product is raised, the quantity demanded will not significantly decrease because consumers still need or want the product. Consequently, total revenue will actually increase because the higher price offsets any small decrease in quantity demanded. Therefore, the correct description of the situation after the price raise is that the quantity demanded will not change much, leading us to focus on the implications for total revenue and demand behavior.\n\nAnswer: (A)", "review1": "Decision: wrong  \nConfidence: 4  \nJustification: The author's response indicates that the quantity demanded will not change significantly after a price increase for a product with inelastic demand. While it's true that for inelastic demand, consumers are less responsive to price changes, stating that the quantity demanded will not change at all (as option A suggests) is misleading. While the quantity demanded may decrease only slightly, it will not remain entirely unchanged. Additionally, the author misinterprets the implications for total revenue, as the correct conceptual conclusion, when a price is raised under inelastic demand, is that total revenue will increase.

The correct interpretation of inelastic demand is that a change in price does not result in a significant change in quantity demanded, but it does not imply that quantity demanded will remain unchanged (as A states). Instead, the correct answer should reflect that total revenue increases due to the price increase; therefore, choice D (Total revenue will not change) is also incorrect and the true correct choice would be that total revenue increases as a result of an increase in price.  \nAnswer: (C) Total revenue will decrease.

While it is true that demand is inelastic, indicating that quantity demanded will not change significantly with a price increase, it is incorrect to say that it will not change at all. This misrepresentation of how quantity demanded responds to price changes in inelastic demand situations is a critical error. Therefore, the answer does not accurately capture the dynamics of inelastic demand. Additionally, while the author correctly identifies that total revenue will increase with the price change, they fail to communicate that subtlety adequately and mistakenly imply that revenue would not change, as indicated in their selection of option A. The correct answer should reflect the slight decrease in quantity demanded leading to an increase in total revenue, which reviewers have pointed out should lead the authors to choose an alternative explanation about total revenue that clearly states its rise rather than flatness.  \nSuggestions: The author should clarify that, although quantity demanded will decrease only slightly due to inelastic demand, total revenue will increase as a result of the price increase.

{"author_response": "Thoughts: In low light conditions, our ability to see colors diminishes because of the different types of photoreceptors in our eyes. Rods are more sensitive to light and function better in dim lighting but do not contribute to color vision. Cones, on the other hand, are responsible for color vision but require brighter light to function effectively. Therefore, the reason Lizette cannot see colors in dim light is that cones are activated in bright light, while rods are activated in low light and do not provide color information.

The correct explanation is that rods allow vision in dim light but do not contribute to color differentiation, while cones are responsible for color vision in bright light.
