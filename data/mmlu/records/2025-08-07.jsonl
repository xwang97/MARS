The relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) is given by Ohm's Law, V = IR.

The traditional distinction between these concepts often becomes less clear-cut in light of his arguments.\n\nFor instance, Singer argues that people have a moral obligation (duty) to help those in need (charity), which upsets the traditional distinction between duty and charity, implying that there is no clear line between actions that we are obligated to perform and actions that we may choose to perform out of generosity.\n\nSinger has also argued that the traditional distinction between egoism and altruism becomes more complex when considering our moral obligations towards other beings (like animals or distant strangers). He believes that an action can be both egoistic and altruistic in a way if it promotes the greatest good for all beings involved.

{"author_response": "Thoughts: This question is asking about the different motivations driving Georgia and Kathy to work at the local hospital. Georgia is motivated by a desire to help others, while Kathy is motivated by making money. The answer that best fits this scenario is D) intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from within oneself, such as a desire to help others, which is what drives Georgia. Extrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from external sources, such as money or rewards, which is what drives Kathy.\n\nAnswer: (D)", "review1": "Decision: right\nConfidence: 5\nJustification: The author's answer and explanation demonstrate a strong understanding of the question and the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.

{"author_response": "Thoughts: The blueness of the daytime sky is not due to light absorption, as that would make the sky appear dark or black, nor is it due to light transmission or reflection, as those processes do not change the color of light. Instead, the sky appears blue due to a process called scattering, specifically Rayleigh scattering. This process occurs when light interacts with molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, causing shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) to scatter in all directions more than longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow). Although violet light is scattered more than blue light, the sky appears blue rather than violet because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and because sunlight reaches us more abundantly in the blue part of the spectrum.\n\nAnswer: (D)", "review1": "Decision: right\nConfidence: 5\nJustification: The author's explanation for the blueness of the daytime sky being due to scattering, specifically Rayleigh scattering, is accurate.
